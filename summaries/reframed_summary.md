# The Ultimate Anime Filler Guide

This website, `www.animefillerlist.com`, provides community-created lists to help anime viewers avoid filler episodes.

**What is Filler?**

Filler episodes are anime content not found in the original manga source material.  They are created to bridge the gap when anime production outpaces the manga's release schedule.  Generally, filler episodes are considered lower in quality than the canon content, both visually and narratively, and do not advance the main storyline.
